## Replication of Kitamura-Stoye (KS) algorithm to test Random Utility Model (RUM)

I replicated table IV (p.28) from KS, for three goods and a budget length of six for years 93-99. I used Matlab code provided from original KS replication package and the github repo from Bart Smeulders. I use CPLEX optimizer from IBM. The replication code and the results can be found in my github we [page](https://github.com/hans-mtz/Adv-Micro/tree/main/PS2).

| Years | $\mathcal{J}_N$ | p |
|-------|----------------|---|
|92-98  | 5.28451371643549e-13 | 0.999000000000000 |
|93-99  | 5.16504555822790e-13 | 0.988000000000000 |

According to KS, $\mathcal{J}_N$=0 if the estimated choice probabilities are stochastically rationalizable. That is, their null hypothesis is that a repeated cross section of demand data have been generated by a population of rational consumers. In this case, we accept the null for both periods.
